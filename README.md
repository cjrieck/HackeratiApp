HackeratiApp
============

Some dependencies:

* [mogenerator](http://rentzsch.github.io/mogenerator/): This is used to generate core data entity files (both machine and human files). This is really nice when working with core data because it'll automatically generate all files for entities and their relationships and then give you, the developer, a human file to interface with that entity. Just download the .dmg or install via homebrew on the website.

* Cocoapods: Just run ```pod install``` and to open the ```.xcworkspace``` file to run/edit
